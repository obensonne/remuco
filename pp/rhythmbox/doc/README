Remuco Client 0.7.1

 Remuco is a Bluetooth/WLAN remote control system for Linux media players. With
Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others you
can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
playlist, browse your media library and activate other playlists, rate your
media and adjust volume. On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
information about the current media, including cover art. Visit http://
remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature list, screenshots and a list of
supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Rhythmbox player proxy. This proxy is actually
a plugin for Rhythmbox.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Requirements

  •  Ryhthmbox >= 0.11.5

  •  Python interface to DBUS (python-dbus)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

3.1. System

 For system wide installation run (as root):

 $ make install

 This installs the player proxy into Rhythmbox' system wide plugin directory.

Note You can adjust the install destination by setting the environment variable
     PREFIX (/usr is used as default).

 Start Rhythmbox and activate the Remuco plugin.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3.2. User

 For user specific installation, run:

 $ make install-user

 This installs the player proxy into the Rhythmbox' user plugin directory (~
/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins)

 Start Rhythmbox and activate the Remuco plugin.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

 The Rhythmbox player proxy gets started automatically by Rhythmbox. The player
proxy then automatically starts the Remuco server. So actually you do not have
to do anything.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Troubleshooting

 To track down errors, please try the steps below. If this does not solve your
problem, come to the help forum.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1. General

 If something fails, it is a good idea to set Remuco into debug mode. This is
done by creating the file ~/.config/remuco/debug, for instance:

 $ touch ~/.config/remuco/debug

 This tells the server and all player proxies to enable debug output. The
server log can be found in ~/.cache/remuco/Server.log. Logging of basic player
proxies (e.g. Amarok, MPD, Totem) goes to ~/.cache/remuco/PLAYER.log where
PLAYER means the basic player proxy's player name. Log sinks of full player
proxies (e.g. Rhythmbox, XMMS2) are proxy specific.

 Inspect the relevant log files to detect what is wrong.

Note Don't forget to remove ~/.config/remuco/debug once you don't need the
     debug output anymore.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.2. Rhythmbox

 To debug the Rhythmbox player proxy, start Rhythmbox from the command line
with enabled debug out, for instance:

 $ rhythmbox -D remuco # Rhythmbox with debug output

The log output hopefully indicates the problem.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server into the
directory remuco-server-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.7.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.7.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/client-0.7.0 remuco-client-0.7.0
