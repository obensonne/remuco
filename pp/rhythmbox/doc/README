Remuco Rhythmbox 0.7.3

 Remuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile
devices equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi. With Remuco you can remotely control
your favorite media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
previous or any other media within the current playlist, browse your media
library and activate other playlists, rate your media and adjust volume. On the
mobile (the remote control) it displays information about the current media,
including cover art. Visit http://remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature
list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Rhythmbox player proxy. This proxy is actually
a plugin for Rhythmbox.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Requirements

  •  Remuco server >= 0.7.1

  •  Rhythmbox >= 0.11.5

  •  Python DBUS bindings (python-dbus)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

3.1. System

 For system wide installation run (as root):

 $ make install

 This installs the player proxy into Rhythmbox' system wide plugin directory.

Note You can adjust the install destination by setting the environment variable
     PREFIX (/usr is used as default).

 Start Rhythmbox and activate the Remuco plugin.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3.2. User

 For user specific installation, run:

 $ make install-user

 This installs the player proxy into the Rhythmbox' user plugin directory (~
/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins)

 Start Rhythmbox and activate the Remuco plugin.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

 The Rhythmbox player proxy gets started automatically by Rhythmbox. The player
proxy then automatically starts the Remuco server. So actually you do not have
to do anything.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Troubleshooting

 To track down errors, please try the steps below. If this does not solve your
problem, come to the help forum.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1. General

 If something fails, it is a good idea to set Remuco into debug mode. You can
toggle the debug mode for the server and all player proxies with the tool
remuco using option --debug. Running

 $ remuco

 tells you if debug mode is on or off. Running

 $ remuco --debug

 switches between enabled and disabled debug mode.

 The server log can be found in ~/.cache/remuco/Server.log. Logging of basic
player proxies (e.g. Amarok, Banshee, MPD, Totem) goes to ~/.cache/remuco/
PLAYER.log where PLAYER means the basic player proxy's player name. Log sinks
of full player proxies (e.g. Rhythmbox, XMMS2) are proxy specific.

 Inspect the relevant log files to detect what is wrong.

Note Don't forget to disable debug mode once you do not need it anymore -
     otherwise you might get quite big log files when running Remuco for
     several hours.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.2. Rhythmbox

 To debug the Rhythmbox player proxy, start Rhythmbox from the command line
with enabled debug out, for instance:

 $ rhythmbox -D remuco # Rhythmbox with debug output

The log output hopefully indicates the problem.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server into the
directory remuco-server-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.7.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.7.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/client-0.7.0 remuco-client-0.7.0
