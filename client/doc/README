Remuco Client 0.7

 Remuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile
devices equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi. With Remuco you can remotely control
your favorite media player - amongst others you can switch to the next,
previous or any other media within the current playlist, browse your media
library and activate other playlists, rate your media and adjust volume. On the
mobile (the remote control) it displays information about the current media,
including cover art. Visit http://remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature
list, screenshots and a list of supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Remuco client, an application running on a
mobile device with J2ME and Bluetooth (JSR 82) or WiFi support. The client
communicates with the Remuco server to remotely control media players.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Building

 You can skip this step if you've downloaded the binary package.

 The client uses the Ant build system (http://ant.apache.org) and Sun's
Wireless Toolkit (http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit), both must be
installed on your system. To build the client, edit the file build.properties
and adjust it to your situation. Then run:

 $ ant dist.jar

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

 Install the file remuco.jar and (optionally) the file remuco.jad on your
mobile device (if you build on your own in the step above: the files are in the
directory dist). How to install is device dependent - please consult the
documentation of your mobile device.

 Once the client is installed on your phone, consider to set permissions so
that Remuco is allowed to use Bluetooth or WiFi. This releases you from always
acknowledging a connection to the server (of course you need to trust Remuco :)
)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

 Play around with the keys and the entries in the menus, I think that's the
best way to get familiar with the client. However, you can find more detailed
information about client usage on the Remuco website http://
remuco.sourceforge.net.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server into the
directory remuco-server-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.7.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.7.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/client-0.7.0 remuco-client-0.7.0
