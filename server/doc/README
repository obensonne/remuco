Remuco Server 0.7.1

 Remuco is a Bluetooth/WLAN remote control system for Linux media players. With
Remuco you can remotely control your favorite media player - amongst others you
can switch to the next, previous or any other media within the current
playlist, browse your media library and activate other playlists, rate your
media and adjust volume. On the mobile (i.e. the remote control) it displays
information about the current media, including cover art. Visit http://
remuco.sourceforge.net for a complete feature list, screenshots and a list of
supported media players.

1. Introduction

 This documentation is about the Remuco server. The server runs on your
computer and intermediates between media players (respectively their Remuco
player proxies) and Remuco clients.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Building

 To build the server, run:

 $ make

 This also checks build requirements and tells you what is needed if something
is missing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. Installation

 To install the server, run (as root, if needed):

 $ make install

 This installs the server below /usr. For an alternative installation prefix
run (for instance):

 $ PREFIX=/usr/local make install

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Usage

 Usage information can be found in the manual page (remuco).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Troubleshooting

 To track down errors, please try the steps below. If this does not solve your
problem, come to the help forum.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5.1. General

 If something fails, it is a good idea to set Remuco into debug mode. This is
done by creating the file ~/.config/remuco/debug, for instance:

 $ touch ~/.config/remuco/debug

 This tells the server and all player proxies to enable debug output. The
server log can be found in ~/.cache/remuco/Server.log. Logging of basic player
proxies (e.g. Amarok, MPD, Totem) goes to ~/.cache/remuco/PLAYER.log where
PLAYER means the basic player proxy's player name. Log sinks of full player
proxies (e.g. Rhythmbox, XMMS2) are proxy specific.

 Inspect the relevant log files to detect what is wrong.

Note Don't forget to remove ~/.config/remuco/debug once you don't need the
     debug output anymore.

A.2. Source Code Access

 You can get the source code via SVN. The SVN root is: https://
remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/remuco

 To browse the SVN repository visit: http://remuco.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/
remuco

 The most current code is located in "trunk". Note that this code is not always
stable or in a working state. The sources of specific releases are located in
"tags" -- getting code from "tags" ensures to have working code.

Example A-1. Check out the current development version of the server into the
directory remuco-server-trunk:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/trunk/server remuco-server-trunk

Example A-2. Check out the client source from release 0.7.0 into the directory
remuco-client-0.7.0:

 $ svn co <SVN-ROOT>/tags/client-0.7.0 remuco-client-0.7.0
